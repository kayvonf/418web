<p style="padding-bottom: .15em">
High-quality rendering is ubiquitous today, with applications ranging
from entertainment to product design and architecture. The goal of this
course is to provide a deep understanding of the fundamental mathematical
and physical principles that are the basis of modern physically based
rendering while also introducing the design principles and engineering
trade-offs involved in designing and implementing high-performance rendering systems.

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Prerequisites</div>


<p>
You should have a working knowledge of computer graphics at the level
of <a href="https://cs248.stanford.edu">CS248</a>. Although CS248 is not *required*, if you have not taken
CS248 and feel like you have the background to take CS348B, please
contact your friendly instructors and let's talk it over.  In
particular, you should fully understand the basic 3D display pipeline,
viewing and modeling transformations, simple geometric modeling using
polygons and quadrics, and hidden surface algorithms like the z-buffer
algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Solid knowledge of integral calculus and basic geometric algorithms is
important.  You should understand the principles behind
object-oriented programming and be a very good C++ programmer.
Previous exposure to signal processing and probability is helpful, but
not absolutely necessary.
</p>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Textbook</div>

<p> There is one required text for the course.</p>

<p>
<div>Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob, and Greg Humphreys</div>
<div>Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation</div>
<div>Third Edition, Morgan Kaufmann, 2016.</div>
<div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0128006455/" target="_blank">[ On Amazon ]</a></div>
</p>

<p>
This book has an extensive <a href="http://pbrt.org">web site</a>
with additional information.
The book is also freely available
<a href="http://www.pbr-book.org/">online</a>.
</p>

<p>
Additional readings will be assigned from research papers from
journals and conference proceedings, and excerpts from conference
tutorials.
</p>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Announcements via Ed Discussion</div>

<p>All class announcements will be made via our <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/21377/discussion/">Ed Discussion</a> forum. Everyone enrolled in the course via Canvas should be able to access this site.</a>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Programming Assignments </div>

You will be given four programming assignments.
We will use a a ray tracing system called <a
href="http://pbrt.org/">pbrt</a>.
This system is a combined C++ codebase
and textbook written in a literate programming language.
Each student is expected
to work individually
and implement your own solutions
(See the collaboration policy for additional guidance).
</p>

<p> <span class="italic_text">Late assignments:</span>
To allow for unforeseeable circumstances,
you will be allowed three weekdays of grace
during the quarter
(to clarify: an assignment due on Friday and turned in
on Monday will use one late day).
Beyond this, late assignments will be
penalized by 10% per weekday that they are late.
On the last programming project,
neither the demo nor the writeup may be late.
Incompletes in this course are given only in exceptional circumstances.
</p>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Final Project and Rendering Competition</div>

<p>
  <span class="italic_text">Final project:</span>
During the last two weeks of the course,
you will propose and work on a self-selected final project.
The final project may be done with one or two partners;
teams may discuss their project with other teams, but may not share code.
Each team will present the project orally during the Rendering Competition
  and produce a detailed write-up describing their work and results.
</p>

<p>For the final project, you will render a new image by
extending the system so that it is capable of
reproducing an image of a real object that it can't currently render
accurately (for example: a gemstone, a puff of smoke, a candle flame,
etc). Check out the <a
href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs348b-competition">results
produced by previous students</a>.

<p>In case the delight of learning does not sufficiently motivate you to
exert yourself heroically on your final project, there will also be a
rendering competition. During finals week, a judging will be held to select
the most impressive final projects.  The rendering competition jury, to be
named later, will consist of computer graphics experts from both industry
and academia. There will be several awards and one grand prize-an
all-expenses-paid trip to <a href="http://s2020.siggraph.org/">SIGGRAPH
2022</a> in Vancouver, Canada</p>


<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Grading</div>

<ul>
<li>Programming Assignments (4): 10&#37; each = <span class="colored_text">40&#37;</span></li>
<li>Final Project: <span class="colored_text">50&#37;</span></li>
<li>Participation (on-line comments): <span class="colored_text">10&#37;</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Hardware and Software</div>

<p>You are welcome and encouraged to do class assignments
on your own machines.
Although pbrt builds successfully on most systems,
the TAs will be able to provide support for compiling pbrt on Linux
(on the public Stanford 'myth' machines, see below),
on Mac OSX, and on Windows (via Visual Studio 2015, or 2017).
Check out
<a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3/blob/master/README.md#building-pbrt">
how to build pbrt</a> for more information.</p>

<p>
If you do not wish to develop on a personal machine, you will have access
to the 'myth' machines located in Gates B08. They can be accessed via ssh at myth.stanford.edu.
</p>

<p> All students with Leland accounts automatically
have accounts on these machines.
Home directories on these machines are shared with other Stanford
Computing Clusters using AFS.
If you do not have a Leland account, consult this
<a href="http://itservices.stanford.edu/service/accounts/sunetids">ITSS
web page</a>.
<!---Registered students will get an extra 500MB of disk quota for
the quarter (Please contact the course staff if your quota does not
increase within 48 hours of signing up for the class).--->  </p>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Collaboration Policy</div>

<p>
Students in CS348B are absolutely encouraged to talk to each other, to
the CAs, to the instructors, or to anyone else about course
assignments.  However, any assistance must be limited to discussion of
the problems and sketching general approaches to a solution.  Each
programming project team must write their own code and produce their
own writeup.
</p>

<p>
Consulting another student's or team's solution is prohibited and
submitted solutions may not be copied from any source.
<span class="colored_text">These and any other form of collaboration on assignments constitute cheating.</span>
If you have any question about whether
some activity would constitute cheating,
be cautious and ask the instructors before proceeding!
</p>

<p>
You may not supply code, assignment writeups, or exams you complete
during CS348B to other students in future instances of this course or make
these items available (e.g., on the web) for use in future instances of
this course (just as you may not use work completed by students who've
taken the course previously). Your github repository for the class must be
made private.
</p>
