<p style="padding-bottom: .15em">
From smart phones, to multi-core CPUs and GPUs, to the world's largest supercomputers and web sites, parallel processing is ubiquitous in modern computing. The goal of this course is to provide a deep understanding of the fundamental principles and engineering trade-offs involved in designing modern parallel computing systems as well as to teach parallel programming techniques necessary to effectively utilize these machines. Because writing good parallel programs requires an understanding of key machine performance characteristics, this course will cover both parallel hardware and software design.
</p>

<p><span class="bold_text">Lectures will be recorded for offline viewing via Canvas.</span>
We will have frequent discussions and student breakouts during live lecture.
Therefore, while attendance at live lecture will not be checked or
  graded, we ask you to make an effort to attend live lecture as much as possible.
  </p>

<p class="bold_text">The course staff will hold both in person and virtual office hours.</p>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Prerequisites</div>

<p>
<span class="bold_text"><a href="https://cs111.stanford.edu/">CS111: Operating Systems Principles</a> is strong prerequisite for CS149.</span>  If you have not taken CS111 and feel like you have the background to take CS149, please contact your friendly instructors and let's talk it over. Note: CS111 is a replacement for Stanford CS's old CS110 course. Since CS111 is a new course that was rolled out in AY21-22, in the Fall 2022 version of CS149, we realize that some students will have taken CS110 and not CS111.
</p>

<p>Concepts we expect you to be familiar with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The idea that a compiled computer program is a sequence of machine instructions.</li>
  <li>That a processor executes machine instructions, and the result of executing an instruction is the update of state stored in registers or memory.</li>
  <li>The motivation for a modern memory hierarchy and it's implementation via registers, on-chip caches, off-chip memory, persistent storage.</li>
  <li>You should be familiar with reading, writing, and debugging C/C++ code (basic C++ features like classes, STL vector types). Programming assignments in this class require debugging skill due to the challenges of debugging parallel code.</li>
  <li>You should have enough programming experience/proficiency in C-like languages to pick up new C-like languages introduced throughout the class (languages such as CUDA, or ISPC) 
  <li>We hope that you've had at least an introductory experience writing code that creates threads, e.g., via std::threads or pthreads in C/C++.</li>
</ul>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Textbook</div>

<p> There is no required textbook for CS149. However, you may find the following textbooks helpful.  However, in general these days there's plenty of great parallel programming resources available for free on the web.</p>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Announcements via Ed Discussion</div>

<p>All class announcements will be made via our <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/30005/discussion/">Ed Discussion</a> forum. Everyone enrolled in the course via Canvas should be able to access this site.</p>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Assignments, Projects, and Exams (What You Will Do!)</div>

<p>
<span class="italic_text">Programming assignments.</span> Students
will complete four programming assignments using parallel programming
systems such as ISPC, OpenMP, and CUDA. You are not expected to know
these languages/systems in advance of the course, you will pick them
up as you go. Programming assignments can optionally be done in teams
of up to two.  Each year there are students that decide to do all
programming assignments by themselves, so it is perfectly acceptable
to go through the class without a partner if you choose to do
so. There will also be one optional "bonus" programming assignment at
the end of the quarter that can be used to boost the grade of any
prior programming assignment.
</p>

<p><span class="italic_text">Written assignments.</span>  Students
will complete five take-home written assignments assigned
approximately every two weeks. Like programming assignments, written
assignments can optionally be done in teams of up to two.</p>

<p><span class="italic_text">Midterm exam.</span> There will be a midterm
exam, held on <span class="bold_text">November 15th</span>. The midterm will be done individually by
students.</p>

<p><span class="italic_text">Final exam.</span> There will be a final
exam during the university designated final exam slot.</p>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Grading</div>

<ul>
<li>Programming Assignments (4): 14% + 14% + 14% + 14% = <span class="colored_text">56%</span></li>
<li>Written Assignments (5): 2% x 5 = <span class="colored_text">10%</span></li>
<li>Midterm Exam: <span class="colored_text">16%</span></li>
<li>Final Exam:     <span class="colored_text">16%</span></li>
<li>Participation:  <span class="colored_text">2%</span>  (async lecture comments)</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="bold_text">Late day policy: Each student (or teach
team) has a total of eight late days for use over the entire quarter.
Late days can be used either for programming assignments or written
assignments.</span> You do not need to notify the staff that you are
using late days. Just submit after the deadline and we will track late
days used.</p>

<ul>
<li>A student can extend an assignment deadline by one day using one
point.  (A team of two students can extend an assignment deadline by
one day using one point from each student.)</li>

<li>If a student does not have remaining late day points, late
hand-ins will incur a 10% penalty per day (up to the max number of
late days allowed). We'll record points on a per-student basis, so if one
student is ``out of points'' and the other is not, only the student
out of late days will be assessed the penalty.</li>

<li><span class="bold_text colored_text">No programming assignments will be accepted more than FOUR DAYS
after their posted deadline. No written assignments will be accepted
more than TWO DAYS after the deadline.</span> This is a hard cap since we need
to release solutions.</li>
</ul>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">FAQ</div>

<p><span class="bold_text">Do I need a partner for CS149?</span></p>

<p>No, you do not.  Each year a number of students decide to do all
the assignments on their own because they think it will help them
learn the material better.  CS149 assignments take a lot of thought,
but do not require writing a lot of code, and so it's reasonable for a
single student to do all the required work.  Note that all teams,
regardless of whether they are one or two person teams, are graded the
same.</p>

<p><span class="bold_text">I don't have a partner but definitely want
one, what should I do?</span></p>

<p>We understand that it can be hard to find partners in CS
  classes. We want everyone that wants to work with a partner to have
  the opportunity to do so. In the first week of class, the course
  staff will run a partner matching service that will ask students to
  fill out a survey and match students according to responses.</p>

<p>If you need to change partners or find a partner in the middle of the quarter, just reach out to the staff and we'll do our best to help you find someone. We are here to help!</p>

<p><span class="bold_text">Do I need to tell the staff that I am using late days on and assignment?</span></p>

<p>No, just submit your assignment. The submission will be time stamped and the staff will keep track of late days.</p>

<p><span class="bold_text">I got sick, had a busy week, had extra
curricular activities, etc.? Can I get an extension?</span></p>

<p>You are going to have periods throughout the quarter where you
cannot put much time in CS149. That's perfectly fine! Late days are
there to allow you to adjust your deadlines. Given that you have eight
late days for the quarter, we expect you to manage those days
according to your needs. We intend to only give students additional
late days under very exception circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="bold_text">Office hours are busy and I'm having trouble getting the help I need. What can I do?</span></p>

<p>Office hours aren't the only time you can get help from the staff.
Just reach out by posting on Ed or writing an email to the staff
asking for an appointment for a 1-on-1 conversation. We'll make time
  to help!</p>

<p><span class="bold_text">Will lectures be recorded?</span></p>

<p>Yes, lectures are recorded by SCPD and available for offline
viewing on Canvas. We try to make lectures participatory and have
in-class discussions, so even though no attendence will be taken, we
hope that you will make an effort to attend lecture as much as
possible and use the recorded lectures as review and reference.</p>

<p><span class="bold_text">Can I audit the class?</span></p>

<p>Please email one of the CAs and we will be happy to add you to Canvas as an observer.</p>
