<p>
Visual computing tasks such as 2D/3D graphics, image processing, and
image understanding are important responsibilities of modern computer
systems ranging from sensor-rich smart phones to large
datacenters. These workloads demand exceptional system efficiency and
this course examines the key ideas, techniques, and challenges
associated with the design of parallel (and heterogeneous) systems
that serve to accelerate visual computing applications. This course is
intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate-level students
interested in architecting efficient future graphics, image
processing, and computer vision platforms and for students seeking to
develop scalable algorithms for these platforms.  </p>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Prerequisites</div>

<p>This is a graduate-level star course with no official prerequisites
for Ph.D. students. Advanced undergraduates and master students are
welcome with instructor permission. Undergraduate and masters student
must have taken 15-418/618 (Parallel Computer Architecture and
Programming) or a commensurate computer architecture course such as
18-447 (but preferably 18-740 or 18-742).  Students will read academic
papers each week, perform a number of short programming assignments,
and conduct a substantial seven-week final project. In addition to
15-418/618, I recommend some graphics experience at the level of
15-462. The more implementation experience you have the better.</p>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Discussion Boards</div>

<p>We will be using Piazza for general class announcements. The
15-769 Piazza signup page is located <a href="http://www.piazza.com/cmu/fall2016/15769">here</a>.</p>

<div class="overview_main_item overview_ruled_element">Collaboration Policy</div>

<p> Students in 15-769 are absolutely encouraged to talk to each
other, to the TAs, to the instructors, or to anyone else about course
assignments. Any assistance, though, must be limited to discussion of
the problems and sketching general approaches to a solution. Each
programming project team must write their own code and produce their
own writeup.

<span class="bold_text colored_text">Consulting another student's or
team's solution, or solutions from the internet, is prohibited. These
and any other form of collaboration on assignments constitute
cheating.</span> If you have any question about whether some activity
would constitute cheating, just be cautious and ask the instructors
before proceeding!</p>

<p> You may not supply code, assignment writeups, or exams you
complete during 15-769 to other students in future instances of this
course or make these items available (e.g., on the web) for use in
future instances of this course (just as you may not use work
completed by students who've taken the course previously).  Make sure
to make repositories private if you use public source control hosts
like github.  </p>
